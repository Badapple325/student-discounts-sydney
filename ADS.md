Ad copy (short variations)

1) Headline: "Sydney students — save today"
   Body: "40+ verified student discounts for Uni of Sydney, UNSW, UTS & UOW. Food, tech, fitness & more. Join the free weekly list."
   CTA: "Get deals"

2) Headline: "Student deals near your campus"
   Body: "Never miss a student discount again — weekly verified deals and local alerts. Free to join."
   CTA: "Join free"

3) Headline: "Save on food & study tools"
   Body: "Student discounts on coffee, software, and more — curated for Sydney universities. Sign up for weekly picks."
   CTA: "See deals"

Creative guidance

- Instagram static image:
  - Size: 1080 x 1080 px
  - Visual: montage of campus + coffee + laptop + discount tag overlay (e.g., "Student deals")
  - Text overlay: Keep headline short; use brand color (#0066cc) for CTA

- TikTok short video (6-15s):
  - Script idea: quick cuts — student walking on campus, coffee, save tag, screenshot of site, CTA.
  - Add caption with UTM link and short pitch.

- Landing page behavior:
  - Use UTM-tagged URLs from ads so UTM hidden fields are captured by the form.
  - Redirect to /thanks.html on successful signup so you can count conversions.

Campaign structure (small test)

- Budget: $40 each on Instagram and TikTok (optional combined $80)
- Ad sets: target 18-25 in Sydney, interests: universities, campus life, student discounts, cheap eats.
- Goal: ~200 visitors and 30–50 signups in 2 weeks to consider scaling.

Creative assets (quick tasks)

- I can create 2 sample images and 1 short script for a TikTok video if you want (I will provide Canva-ready assets or brief directions).

Tracking & measurement

- Use the /thanks.html conversion as the primary KPI for signups.
- Inspect Formspree submissions or use the Formspree dashboard to view which UTM values came through.
- If you add GA4 later, tie conversions to the thank-you page event.

Notes

- Keep messaging local (mention the unis) to improve CTR and relevance.
- Consider testing campus-specific creatives (e.g., "Deals for UNSW students") if one university has better traction.
