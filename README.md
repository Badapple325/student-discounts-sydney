Sydney Student Discounts — MVP

What this is

- A minimal static landing page that lists student discounts near Sydney universities (Uni of Sydney, UNSW, UTS, Macquarie, Western Sydney).
- Searchable list of deals stored in `deals.json`.
- Simple email signup form placeholder (uses Formspree URL) — replace with your MailerLite/ConvertKit embed or your Formspree endpoint.

Files created

- `index.html` — site markup and placeholder forms.
- `style.css` — basic styling.
- `script.js` — loads `deals.json`, renders cards, and provides search/filters.
- `deals.json` — sample pre-populated deals (~20) to start with.

Quick local test

- Open `index.html` in your browser locally. The site will load `deals.json` via fetch; to avoid CORS/FS issues, run a small local server, for example with Python:

  ```powershell
  # from the project folder
  python -m http.server 3000
  # then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
  ```

Deploy to Vercel (recommended)

1. Create a new GitHub repository and push this folder's contents.
2. Sign in to Vercel and choose "Import Project" → select the new GitHub repo.
3. Use default settings and deploy. Vercel will serve the static files and give you a `your-project.vercel.app` URL.

Email signup setup

- Options:
  - MailerLite / ConvertKit: sign up for a free account, create a signup form, and paste their embed snippet into `index.html` where the signup form is.
  - Formspree / Getform: replace `action="https://formspree.io/f/your-id"` with your form endpoint.

Formspree quick setup (fallback)

- Go to https://formspree.io, create a form, and copy the provided action URL. Replace the two `form` action attributes in `index.html` with your endpoint.

Next steps I can do for you (pick any)

- I can push this to a new GitHub repo and connect it to Vercel for you (I'll give instructions for granting access), then deploy and share the URL.
- I can replace the placeholder form with a MailerLite embed if you create a free MailerLite account and give me the embed code (or credentials to configure — optional).
- I can populate the deals list with additional local retailers or convert the data source to Airtable for easy editing.

Promotion & validation plan (2 weeks)

- Post to student Facebook groups, uni clubs Slack/Discord/Discord servers, and Reddit (r/UniSydney, r/UNSW, r/Sydney) with the link to the site.
- Use $50–$80 in Instagram/TikTok ads targeted at 18–25 in Sydney and interests matching university students.
- Measure: aim for 200 visitors and 40–50 email signups in 2 weeks.

Notes

- Replace placeholder Formspree endpoint with a real form provider before running ads.
- Keep `deals.json` up to date; later we can move to Airtable + serverless proxy to allow non-developer edits.

If you'd like, I can connect this repo to Vercel and deploy it now — tell me whether to create a GitHub repo for you (I will prepare files for you to push) or whether you want me to walk you through pushing from your machine.

Additional features added in this workspace

- Expanded `deals.json` with ~40 sample Sydney-focused deals to give better coverage for testing and outreach.

- Experimental Places search (optional)

  - A serverless endpoint was added at `api/search.js` that proxies the Google Places Text Search API. To enable it on Vercel:
    1. Obtain a Google Maps/Places API key with Places Text Search enabled (note: Google requires billing on the project and may bill requests).
    2. In your Vercel project settings, add an Environment Variable named `PLACES_API_KEY` with that key.
    3. Deploy. The front-end "Find nearby businesses & programs" UI will call `/api/search?query=YOUR+QUERY` and display basic results.

  - Caution: Google Cloud may charge for usage. Use the feature sparingly during testing.

- Analytics (GA4)

  - A GA4 placeholder snippet is included in `index.html`. Replace `G-XXXXXXX` with your Measurement ID to enable tracking. If you prefer, provide the Measurement ID and I'll patch it for you.

- Email signup

  - The site currently contains placeholder form endpoints. When you're ready to collect emails I can patch the site with a MailerLite/ConvertKit embed or a Formspree action — paste the embed snippet or the Formspree action URL and I'll update the site and create a commit.

What I can do next (pick any)

- Wire a MailerLite embed (paste the embed HTML) or a Formspree action URL and I'll update `index.html` and push the change.
- Add GA4 Measurement ID for you if you paste it here.
- Expand `deals.json` further or migrate the list to Airtable and wire a serverless proxy so non-dev edits are possible.

If you want me to make one of the changes now, paste the required secret/embed (Formspree action or MailerLite embed, or GA4 Measurement ID) and I'll edit the files and show the commit + push commands.
