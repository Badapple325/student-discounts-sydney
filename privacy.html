    <h3>Cookies & analytics</h3>
    <p>We may add analytics (GA4 or privacy-first providers) to measure traffic and conversions. No personal data is sold. You can unsubscribe at any time via links in our emails.</p>
    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>Contact: <a href="mailto:hello@student-discounts-sydney.vercel.app">hello@student-discounts-sydney.vercel.app</a></p>
    <h3>Form submissions</h3>
    <p>Form submissions on this site are handled by Formspree and are sent to the project inbox you configure on the Formspree dashboard. We store only the information you submit (email and optional university). If you submit a deal, the form may include UTM and referral information to help us track where submissions came from. By submitting you consent to this use.</p>
    <p>If you prefer not to submit via the web form you can email submissions to hello@student-discounts-sydney.vercel.app instead.</p>
